(With Mario Cerrato and Shengfeng Mei, online appendix , submitted manuscript) Abstract: We show that European firms, at the peak of the COVID-19 shock in 2020:Q2, went into a \u201cpanic borrowing\u201d status and drew down 87bn euros in a very short period. We show that firms with less stringent solvency and liquidity constraints drew down their credit lines and accumulated cash. Our study exploits the implications of the social distancing policies to corporate operations across Europe. It proposes a novel empirical framework that identifies panic borrowing while accounting for the endogeneity between credit line drawdowns and an underlying borrowing ability during the COVID-19 shock. We use COVID-19 infection data and proxies for social distancing policies in Europe to study if the increase in risk following the COVID-19 shock can explain the panic borrowing while accounting for possible endogenous credit lines drawdowns. Finally, we show that European corporate drawdowns during the pandemic crisis increased drawdowns, on average, by 3.35 percentage points in response to an unexpected one percentage point fall in their cash flows but only when firms\u2019 earnings are negative. This result is driven by the lockdown policies introduced in Europe. The diagram shows the estimated cross-sectional differential percentage point changes in the drawdown to total assets ratio given a one percentage point change in the EBITDA to total assets ratio during the pandemic. Each cross-sectional difference evaluates the corresponding shift in draw down decisions across the pairwise above- versus below-threshold value. The horizontal axis shows several bandwidth selections proportional to the standard deviation of the empirical distribution summarising EBITDA observations. Each value computed on the vertical axis is evaluated based on a separate estimation with an associated 95% confidence interval. The bandwidth selections considers even intervals around zero-earnings and shows a sharp shift in the firms\u2019 behaviours to draw down credit lines when facing marginally negative earnings while exhibiting no particular decision when facing marginally positive earnings. Optimal Financial Regulation: The interaction between monetary policy and capital regulation Abstract: I show that when the banking sector's assets comprise large excess reserves and loans, jointly determined capital regulation and interest-on-excess-reserves (IOER) policies provide welfare gains. In general equilibrium, falling IOER is associated with a proportional fall in deposit rate only when IOER is above the zero bound. This leads to a faster fall in the bank's interest expenses than its interest incomes. Given any lending level, lower net interest expenses enhance bank solvency. Nonetheless, the risk-weighted capital regulation remains unchanged and hence becomes socially costly. I show that jointly determined policies achieve welfare gains by loosening the capital requirement and lowering IOER to expand the credit flow, while bank failure likelihood remains constant. Conversely, lowering IOER below the zero bound is associated with a nonresponsive deposit rate that leads to growing net interest expenses and worsening bank solvency. In that case, I show that a stricter capital constraint together with a lower IOER provide social value. The social welfare increases towards the inner contour curves depicted by dashed (blue), dashed-dotted (orange) and solid (red) contours. The horizontal solid line describes the RW-capital regulation (I) that is decided in isolation of interest rate policy which is always associated with a lower welfare, relative to RW-capital regulation (II). Regulatory schedule (II) considers the welfare implications of lower IOER and is less strict than (I) and is able to achieve higher welfare relative to (I). Financial Regulation and Wealth Distribution Abstract: Financial regulation provides welfare gains to the society, at the expense of an exacerbated wealth distribution. I show that when capital markets are segmented, financial regulation leads to a transfer of wealth from depositors to equity investors. An integrated monetary and financial regulatory policy achieves welfare gains due to a credit flow expansion to the real sector, while default likelihood within the banking sector remains fixed. Nonetheless, this constrained equilibrium allocation is associated with lower deposit rate while dividends increase, leading to a wealth transfer across market segments. I provide sufficient conditions under which optimal financial regulation leads to welfare gains without exacerbating wealth heterogeneity. Pay Banks to Lend: Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations and the Fiscal Stimulus Abstract: The aftermath of the financial crisis inherited heightened economic uncertainty and low productivity. These features prompted the banking sectors across the developed economies to rely heavily on excess reserves offered by the central banks despite the negative nominal interest-on-excess-reserve (IOER) policy. Nonetheless, the negative relationship between the overall interest expenses of the banking sector with the IOER around the zero lower bound further exacerbates the over-reliance on excess reserves particularly when rates are negative. This paper shows that the new Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) policy adopted by the central banks leads to expansionary effects when the refinancing lending rates fall below the IOER. I first provide a social welfare maximizing approach to determine the optimal borrowing limit. Second, I show that the policymaker's decision to finance the deficit due to remunerations depends on the trade-offs between the social gains associated with the expansion of lending to the real sector against the social costs of monetary tools (creating money to finance the gap) the fiscal stimulus. Joint Fiscal-Monetary Policy Responses to Transitory Aggregate Shocks I show that unilateral fiscal and monetary interventions, in response to transitory aggregate shocks, lead to welfare losses when real interest rates are low or possibly negative. A hyperactive fiscal policy in the forms of increased transfers and suppressed taxation revenues relies heavily on sovereign borrowing to smooth out adverse economic downturns, while the monetary base rate falls excessively to lower cost of finance. In general equilibrium with a banking sector subject to aggregate uncertainty, the transmission mechanism from the monetary policy to the credit sector weakens leading to an exacerbated real economic stagnation and heightened intermediary insolvencies. I show that a joint fiscal-monetary policy that optimally trades off higher credit flows to the real sector against lower rates delivers welfare gains during the transition and long-term by lowering future taxations to settle fiscal borrowing.

This course contributes towards this goal with the following two approaches. First, the course provides a foundation to methodically structure large-dimensional datasets and summarise information into interpretable outcomes. The second part of the course examines how the combination of large datasets accompanied by statistical learning and artificial intelligence techniques are helping practitioners to make more efficient economic and financial decisions. The course is delivered based on a balanced combination of (1) descriptive contents required to formulate financial and economic problems into quantifiable objects of interest, (2) analytical derivations and statistical techniques and (3) software programming. The course is structured based on four pillars. All pillars are equally weighted in terms of course contents and examinations but also in terms of their importance towards developing a foundation for future careers in data science and machine learning in finance within or outside academia: Data Methodological Frameworks Software Implementations Finance Theory and Applications Course Contents Data Science: Theories and Implementations Regression Analysis: Theory Regression Analysis: Implementations and Applications Machine Learning: Theory Machine Learning: Implementations and Applications Prerequisites There is no formal prerequisite, however a prior background including calculus, statistics and regression is favourable. The course assumes familiarity with the estimation and inference of the least squares framework covered earlier in the semester one courses.

This course contributes towards this goal with the following two approaches. First, the course provides a foundation to methodically structure large-dimensional datasets and summarise information into interpretable outcomes. The second part of the course examines how the combination of large datasets accompanied by statistical learning and artificial intelligence techniques are helping practitioners to make more efficient economic and financial decisions. The course is delivered based on a balanced combination of (1) descriptive contents required to formulate financial and economic problems into quantifiable objects of interest, (2) analytical derivations and statistical techniques and (3) software programming. The course is structured based on four pillars. All pillars are equally weighted in terms of course contents and examinations but also in terms of their importance towards developing a foundation for future careers in data science and machine learning in finance within or outside academia: Data Methodological Frameworks Software Implementations Finance Theory and Applications","title":"Overview"},{"location":"pages/Teaching/accfin5246/#course-contents","text":"Data Science: Theories and Implementations Regression Analysis: Theory Regression Analysis: Implementations and Applications Machine Learning: Theory Machine Learning: Implementations and Applications","title":"Course Contents"},{"location":"pages/Teaching/accfin5246/#prerequisites","text":"There is no formal prerequisite, however a prior background including calculus, statistics and regression is favourable.

More specifically, data serves two primary roles: first, to methodically document past and current events into interpretable information, and second, to formulate a basis to make predictions about possible future outcomes. An early example from anthropology Around 5000BC, humans strived just to co-exist amongst their surrounding inhabitants based on their superior intellectual ability to think and act, nonetheless their ability to record and pass down information was the key driver leading them to outgrow and thrive in their habitats. Image represents early form of human-made cave painting as an example of data record from real-world events serving an informative learning media at its time (New Scientists). Each of the aforementioned roles requires a clear understanding of data and relevant methodologies to process them. This course provides a preliminary review of the methodologies relevant to the first role which enables everyone to structure and organise data for the purpose of interpretation, visualisation and preparation for more advanced applications. You will learn about the methodologies relevant to such advanced applications in the forthcoming courses during your studies such as econometrics or other empirical methods courses. Definition of Data From a basic perspective, the concept of data is defined as a collection of numbers, text, symbols, sentiments and many other forms of rudimentary information in an original or unorganised format. This description encompasses a very wide range of observables surrounding individuals, businesses, governments and many institutions. With the advent of technology enhancing the operational performance of societies and businesses, the volume of data has been increasing at an exponential rate. Within the context of business operations and finance, we encounter data in its raw form every day including prices and quantities of investment opportunities traded, social media information, international trade, balance sheet information evolving on an everyday basis and many more. Internal and External Data Sources Data in its raw form bears no meaning and merely serves as a storage of raw facts and figures and only becomes informative when processed and structured towards a specific goal. Therefore, it is quintessential to set a well-specified goal when working with data. This goal is set first, when an individual or an institution produces data according to its operations, for example, companies store their data capturing every aspect of their operations from their early days in their life horizons through their maturity, or alternatively storing every interaction encountered with their customers, clients, suppliers and their own employees. In this sense, it\u2019s important for the company to set a clear purpose for how they intend to use such data since such goals determine how the data is gathered and stored for future applications. This has been an excessively active area within the operations of all companies around the world nearly without an exception during the past decade and becoming continuously even more prevalent. Companies have had a sizeable demand for data engineers to develop scalable and flexible platforms to monitor and store their data capturing every aspect of their operations. Companies perhaps have limited knowledge about how or when they may use such stored data but they fully appreciate the importance of evidence-based and data-driven approaches to learn from their own past performance, maintain their competitive advantages and re-adjust their decision based on all relevant aspects available to them. Reading: The Big Data Value Opportunity Based on the definition of data, it is also important to set a well-specified framework when working with data acquired from external sources since such ultimate goals substantially impact the way data can be acquired, lowering costs and improving many informational efficiencies that ultimately lead to more effective decision making for the users of the data. Navigate to the University central library database platform following the information below. The university provides access to several data platforms such as: Amadeus: Providing balance sheet and corporate operations information for the European firms Financial Analysis Made Easy (Fame): Providing balance sheet and corporate operations information for the UK firms Datastream (via Eikon): Providing corporate financials and other operational information for many countries around the world As a student and part of the university, you will have access to the platforms either directly or via creating an account on the external data platforms.
